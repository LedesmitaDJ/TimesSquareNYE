        <p style="text-align: left;">For 120 years, Times Square has been the center of worldwide attention on New
            Year's Eve, ever since the owners of One Times Square began in 1904 to conduct rooftop celebrations to greet
            the New Year. The first Ball Lowering celebration occurred in 1907, and this tradition is now a universal
            symbol of welcoming the New Year.</p>
